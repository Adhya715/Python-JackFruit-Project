## 📖 Overview

This project is a modular application launcher built using **Python** and **CustomTkinter**. It serves as a centralized hub to launch four distinct applications, demonstrating proficiency in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **Algorithm Design**, and **GUI Development**.

The goal was to move beyond simple command-line scripts and create cohesive, interactive tools with a unified user experience.

## ✨ Key Modules

### 1. 📝 Aesthetic To-Do Chatbot
A conversational task manager that mimics a messaging app interface. It doesn't just list tasks; it talks to you.
- **Features:**
    - Natural language-style commands (`add`, `show`, `delete`, `done`).
    - **Priority Management:** Set tasks to High/Medium/Low priority.
    - **Search Functionality:** Filter tasks by keywords.
    - **Analytics:** `count` command shows completion statistics.

### 2. 🔐 Encryption & Decryption Toolkit
A cybersecurity utility for learning classical ciphers.
- **Supported Ciphers:** ROT13, Atbash, Vigenere, and Rail Fence.
- **Smart Decryption:** Includes a **Brute Force / "Try All"** mode to attempt cracking messages without a key.
- **UI:** Clean split-pane design for input and output with copy-to-clipboard functionality.

### 3. 🧩 Sudoku Solver (AI Powered)
A visualization of the **Recursive Backtracking Algorithm**.
- **Generation:** Creates valid Sudoku puzzles with varying difficulty.
- **Solver:** Instantly solves any valid board using algorithmic recursion.
- **Interactive:** Play the game yourself or let the bot solve it for you.

### 4. 🎮 Rock-Paper-Scissors
A classic game implementation to demonstrate game logic and state management within a GUI.
- **Features:** Score tracking, turn-based logic, and win-condition checks.
